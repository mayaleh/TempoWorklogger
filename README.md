# TempoWorklogger

> Worse is better

TODO:
- refactoring (mvvm)
- move logic to separe projects
- delete template implment
- on update template attributes bug
- csv reader
- add worklog directly into app DB (sqlLite)
- allow sending worklogs added into app DB (mark as sent)
- nice to have: list worklogs from tempo API and allow to delete if Tempo API allows it
- nice to have native MAUI instead Blazor inside webView
